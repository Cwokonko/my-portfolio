      <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
      <img src = "images/Chidera-12.jpg" width=50% height=90%/>
      <p> My name is Chidera Wokonko and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Cornell University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a minor in robotics. 
          Pursuing an engineering degree is no easy task, so to make that transition easier for subsequent classes I serve as a CUempower mentor for a group of freshman students 
          who are part of Diversity Programs in Engineering at Cornell University. When I'm not doing problem sets or studying for an exam I'm working out, watching movies, implementing
          my personal IOT devices or enjoying quality time with friends. I run a fitness vlog on Instagram called COFITNESS and I host weekly conversation hours at my university for 
          people who want to learn the Nigerian native tongue--Igbo. 
       </p>
       <p>.......................................................................</p>
       <p> My favorite thing about being an ECE major is the opportunity I have to navigate the boundary between the 
           hardware and software realm. I'm really passionate about physical computing as it enables me to blur the 
           lines between the digital and physical world. Check out my projects to see how I've put passion to practice.
