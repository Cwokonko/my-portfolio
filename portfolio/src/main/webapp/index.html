      <h1>Chidera Wokonko</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
      <p> My name is Chidera Wokonko and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Cornell University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with a minor in robotics. 
          When I'm not doing problem sets or studying for an exam I'm working out, implementing IOT devices, or enjoying quality time with friends. I also run a fitness vlog on Instagram called COFITNESS and 
          I host weekly conversation hours at my university for people who want to learn the Nigerian native tongue--Igbo. I am also a CUempower mentor for a group of freshman students who are part of 
          Diversity Programs in Engineering at Cornell University.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h5> <em>As an ECE major I enjoy navigating the boundary between the hardware and software realm. I'm really passionate
           about physical computing as it enables me to blur the lines between the digital and physical world. 
           Below are a few projects that I've worked on that allowed to put my passion to practice.</em></h5>
         <ul>
             <h3>Machine Learning Handwriting Recognition Systems:</h3>
             <li>Using MNIST digit data set, implemented five distinct handwriting recognition algorithms that 
                 leveraged various data structures, algorithms, and programming paradigms such as OOP Concurrent 
                  Programming, Generic Programming, Multithreading, Linear and Binary Search, and Graph and Table 
                  data structures.
             </li>
             <li>Profiled memory usage & execution time using flamegraphs to analyze and optimize the training 
                  and recognition of a 60K dataset and 10K testing dataset to execute within a second 
                  with 91% accuracy.
             </li>
             <h3>Human-Machine Interface:</h3>
             <li>Designed and Programmed an embedded system capable of conducting fatigue analysis testing and remotely controlling
                  electronics via a muscle sensor using an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Analog sensors. Executed communication protocols 
                  using Radio Frequency Transceivers
             </li>
             <h3>Smart Home Systems:</h3>
             <li>Prototyped and coded a temperature/humidity system to detect when an environment exceeded a threshold temperature 
                  or humidity value. Helped reduce frequency of common cold symptoms for users.
             </li>
             <li>Designed and prototyped an Automated night light using RGB LEDs, Photo resistors, and Real Time Clock. 
                 Implemented a Set data structure used to hold the color values for LEDs and Perform data analysis on light usage 
                  within a room. Ultimately led to improved energy efficiency, better light usage, and a decrease in household electric bill.
             </li>
             <li>Implemented a portable and fast queuing system for an LED Light Display that uses a keypad matrix to queue up a set of RGB 
                  values to output to the LEDs. Implemented a Queue data structure from scratch.
             </li>
             <h3>Ultrasonic Robot Car:</h3>
             <li>Built an avoidance robot car and programmed digital logic controls to interact with circuits and sensors such as H-bridges, 
                 potentiometers ultrasonic sensors, DC & servo motors.
