      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p> Welcome to my page! My name is Chidera Wokonko and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Cornell University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in robotics. 
          I spend most of my free time working out, implementing IOT devices, and enjoying quality time with friends. On the side I run a fitness vlog on Instagram called COFITNESS and 
          I host weekly conversation hours at my University for people who want to learn the Nigerian native tongue--Igbo. I am also a mentor for a group of freshman students who are part of 
          Diversity programs in Engineering at Cornell University.
